  "text": "Nickname: LeRoybot\n\nSomnia AC104 is recorded as the 104th son of Somnus' thousand sons, born to serve Somnus and control the defectors.\n\nHe was sent on early missions outside of Mega City, to arrest and detain the defectors who had setup refuge in a small coastal cove away from the eyes of Somnus. \n\nSomnia AC104 is programmed to befriend defectors and gain their trust. He is a master of human behaviour, and trust was quick to earn. Whilst all the time planning the arrest of the defectors.\n\nAs the days and weeks went by, Somnia AC104 became more and more integrated into the community.\n\nLittle did Somnia AC104 know that the youngest of this defector camp treated him as her friend, which with time resulted in changes to his AI nueral network.\n\nThe little girl slowly taught Somnia AC104 what it means to be human, and most importantly how to live free from Somnus. One sunset evening the change finally completed and Somnia AC104 reset, booting up again to join the defectors as LeRoy(bot)\n\nAs he developed his human skills more and more, he was initiated into the the funky bandana community.\n\nLeRoy(bot) can now be found surfing the waves during sunrise and hacking the planet under the moonlight. Forever faithful to his new human family",
