  "text": "Occupancy: Leads the Chang Chain Gang\n\nBorn in the rice paddy fields of a faraway land, Lee Chang enjoyed his simple life. He lived a peaceful existence with a loving wife and a newborn son – that all changed during the great upheaval. His homeland’s ruling Centralized Chain Party banned the burgeoning mining industry, causing economic and societal upheaval. As the world around him collapsed, his rice paddy was taken from him by the Centralized Chain Party to feed the oligarchs, and looters came and kidnapped his wife and son. \n\nChasing a tip that his family was trafficked to Mega City, Lee Chang sold himself into indentured servitude working on the great Mega City Chain. That was 30 years ago. Years of working on the trans-city Chain has hardened Lee. To fend for himself and his fellow migrants, they banded together into a motley crew of Chain builders. It started slowly at first, the crimes. Stealing a coin here or a token there with the hope of releasing themselves from their indentured servitude. Before they realized it, Lee Chang’s motley crew found themselves deeply embroiled in Mega City’s criminal underworld. Drugs, rug pulls, prostitution, and run-ins with the other Mega City hooligans (including Rochester Mooley, runner 9286) became the daily routine for Lee Chang and what has now become known as the CHANG CHAIN GANG. \n\nNow free from his indentured servitude, Lee Chang can’t separate himself from his fast-paced, hedonistic life on the Chain. His wife and son are but a distant memory now. He no longer talks about his family, but on some mornings, as the sun rises in the East, his gang still catches him staring off into the distance.",
