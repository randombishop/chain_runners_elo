  "text": "He lives on mega city’s blue side of the tracks. \n\nHe was the inspiration for Eiffel 65 1998 classic ‘blue (Da Ba Dee)’. He’s still suing for royalties.\n\nHe manages a blues bar in downtown Mega and plays the tenor sax on Tuesday nights. He thinks Steve attends regularly in disguise. \n\nBob gets pissed when people call his hair violet blue. Or bubblegum blue. He always responds in the same way ‘It’s just blue man, like the sky.’ \n\nHe smokes blue camels. \n\nHe often gets asked if the drapes match the curtains. It’s nobody’s business. But they do. \n\nHe started a club, the blue chain gang. He’s still waiting for someone to join. \n\nWill anyone join the blue chain gang? \n\nBob will get a blue tattoo if you do.",
