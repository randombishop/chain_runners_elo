Because they know what happens if they don’t. And I always catch them. No matter how fast or how far, they can never escape me. Runner 827. The Chain Running Serial Killing King. But one day, a day I’ll never forget, someone did escape. I don’t know how. It’s as if he operates outside the rules everyone else lives by. I couldn’t catch him no matter how hard I tried. To this day, I’ve never seen him again. The people call him Somnus. One day he’ll be mine.",
