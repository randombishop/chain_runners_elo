  "text": "I've lived in Mega City my entire life. I've never seen beyond the towering walls surrounding the capital. Sometimes I wonder if there's even anything that exists out there, beyond what we know in here. My parents came here from a faraway planet before I was born, seeking refuge, peace, and opportunity from the oppression and terror of intergalactic warfare. Things were better here, for them, and for us. Until Somnus. Ever since he came into power, the peace and opportunity that welcomed them here have slowly been choked away. The home I know is starting to feel more like the terror they left. Last week I was training for the Chain Runner Half Marathon, on my 3rd wave around the Metallic Loop, when Somnus' goons ambushed me. \"Go back to your planet!\" is the only thing I heard before I blacked out. I wish I could've replied \"I was born in Mega City, you idiots!\" but the cold, hard thud of the chain-wrapped pipe spoke first. When I woke up in Mega City Hospital, they had me hooked up to all these different medications. I'd never even been in a hospital before, now my entire face is covered in bandages and I can only see out of one eye. They say I might not even be able to run again. But I'll run. Whatever it takes, however long I have to train, I'll run again. When I do, I'm coming for Somnus.",
