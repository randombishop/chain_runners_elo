  "text": "As recorded in the Grand Archives Vol 6, Somnus had a thousand sons, the Somnia, who \"appear in dreams mimicking many forms.\" From the last chapters recovered from the late poet renegade Sir Virgil III, Somnus Prime was the \"last and final son of Somnus.\"\n\nWhile little information is known about Somnus Prime's whereabouts, his last location on the Great Chain was in the sovereign state of Gotham. \n\nThose with the misfortune of encountering Somnus Prime or his insane clown posse rarely to live to tell the tale. His cruelty was only matched by his brother of Death, Mors. \n\nShould brave runners venture in the dark underbelly of Mega City, avoid Somnus Prime at all costs!!!",
