  "text": "\"So when do we get to visit YOUR planet,\" says the NutriDog vendor, making at least a token effort to remember which of the compartments of their cart contains the products that can be safely digested by the customer.\n\"Depends on how much I like the hot dog,\" they say without a smile. The question is so common that every Centaurian has learned their own rote response to it from a young age. FDR learned long ago not to take offense to it, to brush it off with a joke, to not respond to it as a threat or a come-on or an attempt to pry for cultural secrets.\n\nFDR had been born only a few hundred meters away from this NutriDog stall, and their custom of it and their relationship to the vendor have an oversized, totemic power over their life. Every scrap of flavour that could be siphoned from the protein cylinders was a hope for the future Every time the food had made them sick was an omen. FDR studied the vendor's face carefully for signs that might offer a clue to how this day was going to unfold. Would a crease at the corner of the old wreck's face promise them success? Would the sour odour of the gas released in the first squeeze of the condiment bottle predict a catastrophe? Today was the most important day of FDR's life and the job was a maze of risk and hazard. They needed someone to tell them something. Anyone. Anything.\n\nThey stared at the NutriDog in their hands, cigarette hanging from their green lip by a thin application of saliva. It offered no answers. They ordered a second one.",
