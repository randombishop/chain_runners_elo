  "text": "Born of royal blood, Rosemarie's late father was the last King and she remains the last royal member of the Crown. Her father fought to remove the centralised control of his family as he foresaw the coming revolution for decentralised power through the cypherpunk revolution. Unfortunately he failed however he named his youngest daughter after Marie Antoinette with the hope that she like her name's predecessor could lead the next revolution against Somnus. Her knowledge of both central power and the opportunity for revolution from both sides puts her in a place to be a beacon of hope in Mega City. \n\nRosemary is still inexperienced and part of the Rose Revolution trying to find a way to lead the world back to the decentralisation that has been inhibited by Somnus. \n\nWill she survive? Can she shed her royal blood to support the movement towards decentralisation? Will she help find the weakness to lead the Chain Runners to success?? ",
