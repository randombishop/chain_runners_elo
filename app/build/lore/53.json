  "text": "Runner #219 was nothing but a thought bubble from @Braindraind but then...was Minted on the chain, born to run.  He goes by the name of \"Jimmy\" and feels the need to onboard other new runners to get their bearings.  The runners are family, and are banding together in #MegaCity to take on @somnus before he subverts their existence.  Jimmy lives simply in Mega City.  He's not part of the Hoodie Clan, or the Squid Mask Gang, only knows of the Skulletor Crew from the whispers, dreams of owning a \"Dom Rose\"...and can't even find a hat to be part of the Blit Squad...but he's home.. with the Chain Runners\n\nWelcome to the chain runners.  Glad to have you. ",
