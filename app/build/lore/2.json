  "text": "Dega – a smart, intelligent and hardworking computer scientist. Worked on creation of some of the foundational technology components that runs the Mega city. During early days, she was inspired by the idea of playing a part in building a hub that enables multiple opportunities. As time goes by, Dega realised how Somnus has grown too powerful and is deceptively exploiting the habitats of Mega City. \n\nRene – a humble, ever optimistic and charming pianist in the Mega City. He believes in creating and spreading joy through finding good within himself and others around.  Rene firmly believes that the purpose of life is giving a purpose to it. What is his purpose?\n\nThe day Rene and Dega met each other, they felt an immediate deep connection through their bones -a strong emotional bond that extends from their many previous births. Rene and Dega realised that they are made for each other and want to spend rest of their lives together. Their match is on-chain!\n\nBut unfortunately, there are forces beyond ordinary trying to stop them unite. Their love is forbidden in the Mega City. But why? Rene and Dega are on the run, not just trying to protect themselves and live together. But also, they seek to bring a meaningful change that is equitable for all in the Mega City.\n\nTogether (Rene + Dega) they will play an important role in bringing an end to the order and free Mega city.\n Chain Runners, will you help the young lovers stay united? Will you support them?",
