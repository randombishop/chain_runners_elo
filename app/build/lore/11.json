  "text": "Robert had an amazing career as a clown… he did Bar Mitzvahs, weddings and even popped into his local traveling circus for a cameo anytime they were in Springfield until one day he scored the gig of a lifetime – Herschel “Krusty” Krustoksy had the biggest variety, comedy show on the air and Robert had finally gotten his big break and was going to be a regular on the show.\n\nFor years Robert loomed in shadow of his friend, despite being infinitely more talented and driven… but above all, Bob was loyal, and he didn’t understand why he couldn’t seem to get ahead until one day when he was walking back to his car after a taping, a man in a dark coat and glasses approached him.\n\n“Well, Bob” he said “it appears this introduction is long over due…” \n\n“Um, excuse me, do I know you” Bob said… \n\n“Oh yes, you do… and you don’t.  Do you really want the answers you seek?”\n\nBob looked into the mans sunglasses only to see his own reflection and he pondered whether this could be the day Sideshow Bob finally got ahead in this world…\n\n“Cut to the chase – what do you want from me?” asked Bob.\n\n“Nothin, I’m only here to give you a choice.  Take the blue pill and stay in Springfield, and enjoy your slumber… or you can take the Red Pill, and follow me down the rabbit hole…”",
