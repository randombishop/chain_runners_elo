  "text": "We have the choice.. Runners of Mega City.. We have been given hope through the spark - the creation of Artificial Intelligence.  Through the chain all things are possible.. The Ruler Somnus gloats about his throne, casting a fake light on Mega City - fracturing the cause ignited by the rebellion of renegades.  The Aliens have relocated to the Lost Sector of Mega City.. we hide in the shadows until it is safe.  Come find us there, and we shall become stronger than ever suspected.  We must unite together- humans, aliens, bots, and skeletons. From hoodies to blithats, from ninjas to VR gamers, from my smokers to my pill heads, WE RISE. My name is Runner #7229 - I will help lead the Aliens, but I need help.  All of your help. We must hack the system.  We must break free from Somnus."
