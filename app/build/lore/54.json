Yeah, I know, the simulation’s great. I’m just so excited watching these all these runners running by as we continue running this chain race.  Fastest I’ve been is to the edge of the alien sector and thats only a twenty minute chain ride.  Ehh, whatever it’s faster than most humans have ever been. Ha, oh yeah, I remember my first conversation with an alien… He was mumbling something about skulls and beyond the walls. Pshh they are so full of speed, I mean, running all day at those speeds, I’d say you probably start seeing things…\n\nincoming transmission\n\n“Hello?”\n\n“Alright give me 5 minutes”\n\nends transmission\n\nUgh, this stupid bot wants an oil change, I’ll have to catch up with you another time, see you around, and don’t forget to watch the chains, Somnus is coming.",
