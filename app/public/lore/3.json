  "text": "Everyone runs. Chain prom queens and chain quarterbacks. Chain nerds and chain dorks. Chain moms and chain dads. Chain crooks and chain saints. When they see me, they always run. Because they know what happens if they don’t. And I always catch them. No matter how fast or how far, they can never escape me. Runner 827. The Chain Running Serial Killing King. But one day, a day I’ll never forget, someone did escape. I don’t know how. It’s as if he operates outside the rules everyone else lives by. I couldn’t catch him no matter how hard I tried. To this day, I’ve never seen him again. The people call him Somnus. One day he’ll be mine.",
