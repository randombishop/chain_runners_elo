Chip was raised by robots and sports a Robo-Cyclopian mask that helps him to see the world through a robo-colored lens. \n\nWhile Chip is an expert hardware engineer, his nickname comes from the bag of Cool Ranch Doritos he always travels with. Chip came from an abusive home. After he disassembled the family vehicle at 4 years' old, his parents drove him to the outskirts of Mega City and abandoned him. Chip was taken in by robots that didn't know how to care for a human. His new robo-family stumbled upon a Doritos truck engulfed in flames and salvaged the blue chips to save the boy from starvation. Noticing his head felt as cold as their metal skin, they also salvaged from the wreckage the hat he wears today, a token of his new family. \n\nA security blanket of sorts, Chip carries a bag of Cool Ranch Doritos with him everywhere he goes. When asked about this eccentric behavior, Chip simply replies \"Cool Ranch Doritos are clutch\"",
