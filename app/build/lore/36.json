  "text": "Runner #8598 aka Maya, the AlienGangsta \n\nMultidimensional, been around the block, hacking planets, chilling on the moon, getting high with the sun. She sits at the Galactic Federation. Earned her way up, gangsta style. \n\nIntended to chill for the rest of eternity but quickly got bored then decided to see whatsup on earth. The human matrix rabbit hole looked quite entertaining. After seeing the mess and chaos, she decided it was time to awaken the masses and activate the golden age of consciousness. Time for an evolutionary shift Earthlings! \n\nRaise human consciousness and ascend their frequency was her mission. Many others from her tribe landed on this planet with the same mission, so she is on the lookout to help activate their DNA. Some have the same tattoo on their forehead, others have been reincarnated into skulls, bots and even humans. \n\nShe got fed up by the human species tho. They can be very dumb sometimes, polluting the planet with their nonsense. Vibrations being too low all around, she made Mega City her home instead, she thrives better in high frequency. \n\nClearing all that dark energy from the universe can be a headache, thus the smoking. A quick ciggy break to realign with cosmic energy and she’s back again.\n\nShe never stops. She’s a gangsta. She is Maya, aka the Alien Gangsta",
