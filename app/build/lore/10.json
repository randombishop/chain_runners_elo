  "text": "In a dark dingy corner in the Lost Sector of Mega City you can find #7021 operating a small, un-assuming Laundromat. \n\n\"Kind of gross to be getting your clothes cleaned by the the wierd alien thats always smoking out of his pipe\" don't you think?\n\nWell. Thats probably why they don't seem to get many customers during the day & why the place holds a lousy 2 star rating on google.eth.\n\nHowever... for those in the know, ED'S LAUNDRY EMPORIUM is the place to go for action - you'll find some of Mega City's most degenerate inhabitents frequenting this locale. Whether you're into high stakes space-horse betting, intergalactic holdem, or just looking for the finest opium on this side of the galaxy - just ask for #7021.",
