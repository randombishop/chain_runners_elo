Not much can be said that can glorify the sewer channels that are the intestines of many cities. Not much can be said about this one. But in an area right underneath the city center, a large mass of thousands upon thousands of what appeared to be cables fed into a room. The room was dimly lit with what appeared to be a green fluorescent light that shimmered off the rows of computers; all of which were being used. \n\n   The air was filled with the clicking sounds of keyboards and mouses; a sound that vibrated and expanded into a symphony that ebbed and flowed. And on one of these computers was a bot smoking and typing away with a feverish speed but curiously nonchalant face. It was not particularly different from any other bot. With glasses that magnified its yellow eyes, a pink mohawk, and large gold hoop earrings, it sat looking at the screen with great intensity. Then the screen suddenly went dark and a message appeared.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nه҈ͣفͤ҈ͥ҉ͦ҈ͧ҉ͨ҈ͩ҉ͪ҈ͫ҉ͬ҈ͭ҉ͮ҈ͯ҉ͨ҈ͬ҉ͧ҈ͣ҉ͨ҈ͧ҉ͯ҈ͮ҉ͭ҈ͤ҉ͦ҈ͥ҉ͧ҈ͩ҉ͭ҈ͨ҉ͣ҈ͪ҉ͧ҈ͣ҉ͨ҈ͧ҈ͭ҉ͩ҈ͤ҉ͮ҈ͯ҉ͬ║ͣ͏ͤ\n#ï͂͑\n₀₂₁⁵⁸⁵⁹⁶⁹⁵₂₁₃₁⁴ ⁶⁴₂₁₀₀₂⁷⁶⁹⁷⁹₂₁ ₀ ⁶₃₂₀₁₀⁸₃⁹⁷₃ ⁵₂ ⁶ ⁸ ⁴₃₀₃⁹⁷⁹⁷ ⁹₃₁ ⁴₂⁸ ⁵ ⁹⁶⁸ ⁶⁸⁵ ⁸⁵₀₂⁶ ⁶⁴ ⁸⁵ ⁶₂⁴ ₀₂₀₂₁₃ ₁⁷⁵⁸ ₃⁷⁴ ⁷⁵₀₂₀⁷ ⁶⁸ ⁵ ⁹⁷ ⁶ ⁸⁹⁷₁₀₀₁\n╪ͥͥͥ╪ͥͥͥ╪ͥͥͥ╪ͥͥͥ╪ͥͥͥ╪ͥͥͥ╪ͥͥͥ╪ͥͥͥ╪ͥͥͥ╪ͥͥͥ╪ͥͥͥ╪ͥͥͥ╪ͥͥͥ╪ͥͥͥ╪ͥͥͥ╪ͥͥͥ╪ͥͥͥ╪ͥͥͥ╪ͥͥͥ╪ͥͥͥ╪ͥͥͥ╪ͥͥͥ╪ͥͥͥ╪ͥͥͥ╪ͥͥͥ╪ͥͥͥ╪ͥͥͥ╪ͥͥͥ╪ͥͥͥ╪ͥͥͥ╪ͥͥͥ╪ͥͥͥ╪ͥͥͥ╪ͥͥͥ╪╪╪╪\nΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞΞ\n\nYou thought you could enter my system without notice?\nYour cause is hopeless.
