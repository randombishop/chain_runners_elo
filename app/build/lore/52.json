  "text": "Jay and MJ first met at the Mega City Café for coffee three years ago on a sunny summer afternoon. The runners were out in full force, but they’d been through the dating rat race for so long that they were beginning the lose hope. When MJ approach Jay to give him a hug, she could smell the Crown Kush that was hiding in his back pocket, rolled into a perfect joint. Jay knew he was going to smoke it one way or another, but after cappuccinos, croissants, and a long conversation about life, they found themselves smoking it together under the Lover’s Bridge, near the Quad Stream river in the Downtown District. They’ve been inseparable ever since, and can often be seen walking down the river, pipes in their mouth, holding hands and smoking the finest herb this side of the galaxy. Four months ago, they finally opened their dream shop, the Mega Buds Dispensary and Coffee Shop, where all Chain Runners are welcome to slow down and take the edge off. See you there soon!",
