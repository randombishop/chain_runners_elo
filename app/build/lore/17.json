He likes to brag his family survived it too, though they did not survive him for long after it's conclusion. Not much else is known about #3306: his name, his background, his upbringing, dark as it must have been. But through that darkness, there remains a persistent smile on his face. Call it a perverse sense of humor. Call it the look of a man passionate about what he does, of one following his life's calling. Happiness is derived from the strangest of sources. \n\nRumor has it #3306 snapped during The War. Something ticked, and then broke in a cacophony of laughter. He owns his madness, defines himself with it. But watch out. You might not be as far from joining him as you may think. \"All it takes is one bad day to reduce the sanest man alive to lunacy. That's how far the world is from where I am. Just one bad day.\"",
