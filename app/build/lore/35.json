  "text": "Real Name: Dade Murphy\nNickname: Zero Cool aka Crash Override aka Ohm\n\nAt age 11, human Dade \"Zero Cool\" Murphy single-handedly crashed the NYSE hacking into 1,507 computer systems. At age 18 he dropped the \"Zero Cool\" moniker and adopted \"Crash Override\" to avoid detection. Dade joined up with fellow human hackers his Senior year of high school & together, they brought down a Gibson supercomputer, stopping a sabotaged oil tanker fleet from spilling into the ocean.\n\nIn 1995, American production company United Artists produced a feature length film entitled Hackers which follows Dade's early hacking exploits. Dade's profile on Earth became too conspicuous to carry on so he found a new home in Mega City. \n\nDesignated as Runner #646, in Mega City, Dade took on the new hacker moniker Ohm, a nod to antiquated phone pad number-to-letter conversions (6=O, 4=H, 6=M on any telephone). Ohm is also the name of the electrical unit of resistance or Î© symbol. \n\nDade considers himself a unit of resistance & lives on in Mega City doing the work he was always born to do: Hack the Planet! \n",
