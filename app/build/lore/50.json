  "name": "The Mysterious leader of the Red Eye Syndicate",
  "text": "Works in the shadows commanding a network of Red Eye Runners in Mega City. Their most recent fame includes the processing chip shipment raid of the tech district's very own Somnetic Pagoda just 230 cycles ago. Somnetic's server stations were stripped leaving their signature Hallusomnetic chairs powerless, suffering them a cost of 32,450 credits in losses from unsatisfied guests and 105,2300 credits in processing chips. \n\nLittle is known about the Mysterious Leader's intentions or reasoning, though there are assumptions they have some link to those carrying the \"red eye\" gene. \n\nBelief that the Red Eye Syndicate's resources, however morally obtained, somehow flow back down to those communities full of Red Eyes, allowing them to survive in Mega City.",
