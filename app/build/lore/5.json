The perfect life. \n\n7/11/2021. 13:25pm\nArrives home early from work. \nWho's boots are these by the door?\nWhy is there a belt on the stairs?\nWho's cowboy hat is that?\nIs that my wife moaning?\n\nEnters bedroom. \n\nDon Juanito. \n\nStood tall in all his masculine godlike beauty. Unfazed. \nHe turns in a flash. Guilty smirk. \nA blinding light. \nHe is gone. \nA rose petal slowly floats to the floor. \n\nHal, heartbroken, defeated, lost. \nTurns on computer.\nLogs in to BlitBook. \nPosts anonymous blog warning others of the villainous Don Juanito. \nExhausted he falls asleep at his desk in a puddle of tears. \nHours pass. \nPing. A notification. \nPing ping, another two.\nPing ping ping. \nHe checks inbox - 1497, 1498, 1499 messages, more incoming, rising by the second.\n\nHe stirs. \nHe is not alone. \nSomething must be done. \nDon Juanito must be stopped. \nHe grabs his coat. \nHe dons his special cap. \n\nBlitcap Hal is born.",
